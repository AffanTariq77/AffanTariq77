## Hi there 👋

I am a Senior Full-Stack AI Engineer who builds scalable, production-ready web applications with a strong foundation in backend engineering and the frontend expertise needed to deliver complete, seamless products. I have worked on enterprise-level projects and products using the .NET ecosystem alongside React and Angular, with extensive experience deploying and scaling solutions on Microsoft Azure.

Driven by the belief that learning never stops, I continuously focus on deepening my backend expertise while expanding into AI-driven systems and modern technologies. My greatest strength lies in my ability to rapidly learn, adapt, and apply new tools and concepts to solve complex, real-world engineering challenges.
